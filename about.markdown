This is a personal blog page where I write about my past, current and future projects as well as technologies that I find interesting. 

The blog was created as a consequence of curiosity and is one of the very first projects to be documented on this blog.

The blog is created in Jekyll and started it's journey from the minima V3 theme from which it will evolve.
